/*  
    Create a new class called `Employee`.
    Make sure to call your constructor, and 
    require these 2 parameters: name, shifts.

    Create a method on the class called 
    `getSchedule` that prints a string:
    [NAME] works on [SHIFTS]
    Where NAME and SHIFTS reference the values
    stored on the object.
*/

//CODE HERE

        this.shifts = shifts

        console.log(`${name} works on ${shifts}`)
    }
}

/*
Create a new instance of your class.
Save it to a variable called `empOne`.

You can use this sample data or make
up your own:
name: Jess
shifts: weekday mornings, weekday afternoons

//CODE HERE
// employee1.getSchedule()

/*
    Make a copy of the empOne object
    using the spread operator.
    Save it to a variable called `empTwo`.

    Change the name of `empTwo` to 'Nick'.

    Hint: you can do this inline with the 
    spread operator or reassign it using 
    dot or bracket notation.

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*  
    Write a class called Manager that *extends* 
    the Employee class. In the constructor, 
    make sure you require all of the parameters 
    from the Employee class as well as 1 
    new one: employees, which will be an array of 
    employees that report to this manager. 
    (Hint: don't forget to call the super function)

    Create a method called `getEmployees` that
    console.logs a string:
    [NAME] manages [EMPLOYEES]
    Where NAME and EMPLOYEES reference the values
    stored on the object.

    Create a second method called `addEmployee`
    that takes in one argument, `emp`, which
    should be a string of an employee name.
    The function should push the name into 
    the employees array.
